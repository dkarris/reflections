What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 .git hidden folder is created but no initial commit is made.
 
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 - if offers sort of pre final - testing milestone before submitting into commit
 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- debug and make sure that the logical change is implemented at  the staged area. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
 - When introducing a drastic new feature/ design it is very helpful to have the backup points that are really easy to restore.

 How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help to understand the logical structure and flow of the project. Additionally they prevent fro creating unreachable commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging branches allows us to create one master branch having the features and designs from the previous separate branches.

Here is my lesson 2 end of reflections.
